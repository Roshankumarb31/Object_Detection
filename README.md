# Object_Detection

I have worked on a project for Smart India Hackathon, where i developed a system to be implemented in the cctv cameras of railways for 
<li>
1. Crime detecion
2. Crowd management
3. Work monitoring
</li>
I have utilized Computer Vision techniques such as object detection and anomaly detection along with image and video classificaiton and processing techniques. Along with that, i have utilized scalable vector databases for more efficiency.

This proves my efficiency in computer vision algorithms such as YOLO and CNNs along with project management and collaborationÂ skills.
